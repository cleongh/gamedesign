* Introduction


** Game design classes

- An overview on the most relevant aspects of game design and level design
- We will try to review /many/ things, although there is much more

* Creating videogames

** Creating experience

Games are all about experience

Games occur in the player's mind

In general terms, what we do as designers is create dynamic experiences


** Games are free (as in freedom) virtual experiences

Players play freely, they enjoy it (intrinsic motivation)

However, games happen in time and spatial constraints


# ** Types of games [@caillois2001man]

# - Agon: Competences
# - Alea: Luck
# - Mimicry: Simulation
# - Ilinx: Vertigo


# *** Agon

# #+CAPTION: Players are relatively equal, and they must show they superiority
# [[file:street_fighter.png]]

# *** Alea

# #+CAPTION: Players do not control they fate, but they try to overcome/win over
# destiny
# [[file:poker.png]]

# *** Mimicry

# #+CAPTION: Simulation (more or less realistic) of a ruleset
# [[file:wow.png]]

# *** Ilinx

# #+CAPTION: Experience emotions outside everyday reality

** Designing videogames requires work

Finishing a complete game desing is not a simple task of big "creativity"

# [@kaufman2009]

It requires knowledge, teamwork and a lot of experience

** Particularities of a videogame

Videogames are complex and involve many forms or art and technology

#+REVEAL: split

Designing a videogame is a /design/ task, there is no automated pipeline ensuring a good gameplay

#+REVEAL: split

A game designer should have these skills:

- Plays a lot
- Able to come up with non-video games
- Knowledge on art (music, sound)
- Some knowledge on technology/programming
- Write decent narratives
- Abstraction skills
- Communication and writing skills
- LOVES videogames

#+REVEAL: split

A game design has (among other, and as a simplification), two main perspectives:

- /High level design/: concept, concept expansion, formal draft
- /Low level design/: interface, mechanics, tools, narrative, *game design document*


*** Game specification

It is not uncommon to refine an idea iteratively when designing a videogame:

1. The player can use keys
2. The player can use keys of several types
3. The player can use two types of keys. Red ones will open the master room, and green ones will open any other door

#+REVEAL: split

4. [@4] The player can use two types of keys. Red ones will be found only once per dungeon, and at least \(n > 15\) rooms from the initial one. Each dungeon contains, exactly \(k\) green keys, which correspond to all locked doors in the dungeon

** Game and player

Games are pleasant to the player. Why?


*** Surprise and discovery

Games produce surprise

Overcoming uncertainty and discovery is rewarding


*** Problem solving and challenge

Playing means challenge--without it, boredom happens!

Solving a conflict is pleasant

*** Playability

Playability is the set of properties that describe the player experience
in a certain game

#+REVEAL: split

Playability determines the /game genre/

* Game design document (GDD)


The magical recipe for structuring a game design idea does not exist

#+REVEAL: split

However, there are some good practices that are worth considering when writing down a design



** The GDD contract

The GDD is a great way of communication between all members of a development team

In theory, all decisions should make it to the GDD, and whatever is written there should be assumed to be a decision


** What the GDD contains can vary

The GDD depends on the team, and must be useful, not strict and
cumbersome

#+REVEAL: split

There are three detail levels that, some times, are laid out in different documents:

- Overview: the general concept and ideas
- Details: all mechanics and details. It is great as the design knowledge base
- Story: The lore, settings and overall story leading to (or happening in) the game

** GDD examples

- [[https://gamedevs.org/uploads/grand-theft-auto.pdf][GTA original]]
- [[http://www.graybeardgames.com/download/diablo_pitch.pdf][Diablo]]


** Info in the GDD

*** Basic information

- Title (tentative)
- Brief synopsis (1 paragraph)
- Genre
- Age range
- PEGI info
- Target audience

*** Lore and context

Description of the game world (fantasy, sci-fi, no story at all...)

*** Core loop

The sequence of top-level abstractions that will keep the players engaged:

*Prepare*, *challenge*, *reward*

*** Mechanics

- Walk: the player can walk by using the left stick...
- Jump: pressing ~X~ the player can jump 40 game units
- Time: the level must be finished en 300s
- Take item: ...

*** Dynamics

What *top level experiences* will arise from using the mechanics?

*** Aesthetics

- Graphics (with examples!)
- Music

*** Controls

- Gamepad controls
- Keyboard controls
- ...

*** Tables and data

| Enemy  | Life | Speed |
|--------+------+-------|
| Turtle |   10 |     1 |
| Zombie |    1 |     3 |


* Mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics

# [@Hunicke04mda:a]

** Game mechanics

The interactions and relations the player faces after removing aesthetics, technology and story

# [@Schell:2014:AGD:3006351]

#+REVEAL: split

Game mechanics are also described as rules or simulations that let the user learn and explore the possibilities through feedback mechanisms

# [@Koster:2013:TFG:2601678]

#+REVEAL: split

All the game components and the relations between them

# [@Schell:2014:AGD:3006351]:

- Space
- Resources, attributes and states (information)
- Actions
- Rules
- Abilities
- Luck


*** Space

#+CAPTION: Space is determined by the places in the game and their interactions

[[./tetris.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

The space is also determined by the /dimensions/

The dimensions are not only aesthetics, they are also a design tool

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: 2D
[[./joypack.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: 3D
[[./threedi.png]]



*** Resources

Game mechanics include the resources (and their logic):

- Platforms
- Coins
- Enemies
- Life
- ...

#+REVEAL: split

Resources can be shown to the user

[[./lifebar.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

However, in game mechanics, not all resources will be visible:

- Speed
- Damage
- Random number thresholds
- ...

#+REVEAL: split

Classic game design also divides resources into:

- /consumable/
- /non-consumable/

#+REVEAL: split

Resources also have attributes and state:

- =position=
- =life=
- =ammo=
- =...=

#+REVEAL: split

Through display, sound and interface, we transmit *resource information*

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Differentiation between player and enemy
[[./angrybirds.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: A more complicated scenario for resource information. But still, we can identify resources
[[./war.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Again, it is important to remember that the player does not have to have /all the information/

#+begin_quote
  Do we need to know the exact speed of a football in a match?
#+end_quote



*** Actions

There are two kinds of actions in a game:

- Operative actions
- Resulting actions

#+REVEAL: split

/Operative actions/ are those carried out by the player

In Super Mario Bros: =jump=, =run=, =chrouch=

#+begin_quote
  The less, the better
#+end_quote

#+REVEAL: split

/Resulting actions/ are consequences of the application of /operative
actions/

In Super Mario Bros: =kill enemy=, =break block=, =use turtle shell=

#+begin_quote
  The more, the merrier
#+end_quote

#+REVEAL: split

One of the most common and useful ideas is that by reducing the amount
of operative actions and increasing the amount of resulting actions, a
game can become "easy to play, difficult to master"

#+REVEAL: split

Now, for a couple genre examples...



*** Beat'em up

#+caption: Brawler games
[[./images_brawler.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

- 4-way movement
- Punch-kick-jump
- Co-operative game
- Steal weapons
- Power Ups (Health)
- Choose protagonist
- Special attacks
- Final bosses



*** Hack'n'slash

[[./gow.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

- Third-person camera
- Weak-strong attack
- Combos
- Counter-attack
- Ranged attack
- Block
- Dodge
- Finishers



** Game dynamics

The run-time behavior of the mechanics acting on player inputs and each other' outputs over time

#+REVEAL: split

The game dynamics are the high level phenomenon that, built on the mechanics, creates the "gaming story"

#+REVEAL: split

For instance, constructing a basic city in Age of Empires 2:

# #+begin_html
#   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZLdHkVj6ka8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
# #+end_html



** Game aesthetics

The desirable emotional responses evoked in the player, when interacting
with the game system

[[./aesthetics.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Canonically, aesthetics include graphics and sound

However, many other aspects of a videogame can be considered part of the aesthetics

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Limbo's aesthetics
[[./limbo.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

# #+begin_html
#   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hgZXiHfNt0M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>  </iframe>
# #+end_html

Music is also fundamental in a game



** Puzzles

Puzzles have a problem: once they are solved, *the dynamics vanish*



** Puzzles are heavily present in videogames

#+caption: Puzzles are fundamental in Portal 2
[[./portal2.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Videogame puzzles maximize user immersion when the objective and the
puzzle-solving mechanics are well integrated with the gameplay


** Feedback is fundamental in puzzles

One of the most typical sources of frustration in players is not finding
out whether they are doing the right thing or not

Good puzzles inform the user about the objective (what is to be solved)
and the player's progress



** Puzzles are a dangerous piece of game desing

Puzzles that block players can expel users

There are many ways to avoid this:

- Give the solution (at a price, of after several tries)
- Hinting
- Alternative paths

* Story and narrative


#+REVEAL: split

One of the most effective tools for engaging in a video game is a good
narrative



** Narratives are ubiquitous

We, humans, love narratives. We tell and hear narratives every day

Conveying content through narratives is both effective and pleasant for
the player



** Characters

Narratives tell human lives

Therefore, characters are the main vehicle for narratives in game design



** Games already have characters!

Additionally, we are already using virtual characters

#+caption: Nathan Drake

[[./nathandrake.png]]




*** Emotions

As players, we connect with the virtual characters

We understand and feel emotions, and this can leverage the perception of
the game

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Last of us
[[./lastofus.png]]



** Plot

The narrative plot is one of the main constituents of a story

Classic plots work well in videogames, and do not distract players from
the gameplay



** Different plots and endings

In a videogame, we can let the player experience different plots,
according the player's decisions

#+REVEAL: split

Actually, multiple plot exploration exists in "choose your your adventure"-like narratives

#+caption: Black Mirror: Bandersnatch
[[./bander.png]]



** Narrative vs. open world

#+caption: Red Dead Redemption 2
[[./rdr2.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

One of the longest standing objectives is to provide an open game in
which great narratives occur, no matter the player's choices

Technically (both from the writers and the programmers), this is
unachieved and challenging

#+REVEAL: split

It is hard to combine the possibilities of open worlds with the richness
of good narratives, but there are ways to "provide" both

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: In Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, the player can wander around the world, or interact at specific places for a good narrative
#+attr_html: :width 300px
[[./skyrimnarrative.png]]



** Level ambience also tells a story

The aesthetics, the ambience and the decoration contribute to conveying
a narrative

#+REVEAL: split

* Player cognition

# [@hodent2017gamer]


#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_quote
  Videogames happen in the mind of the player
#+end_quote

#+REVEAL: split

Understanding player cognition is an invaluable tool for good game
design



** Motivation and gameplay

Player's behavior is affected by /motivation/



** Intrinsic motivation

Intrinsic motivation happens when the reward is internal

#+begin_quote
  For instance, being the first player in the classification to show off
#+end_quote



** Extrinsic motivation

Extrinsic motivation happens when the activity to be carried out is not
an objective, but leads to another motivation

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Gold farming in League of Legends leads to better objects
[[./goldfarming.png]]



** Reinforcement

Reinforcement is a classic way of controlling behaviour



*** Rewarding the player

- Consumable prizes (coins)
- Level prizes (leveling up)
- Game mechanic prizes (improving/easening mechanics)
- Narrative prizes (more story)
- Emotional prizes (characters and their relationships)
- Places (unlocking new places)
- Achievement (winning 100% of the game)

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Super Mario Bros mushrooms are a classic prize
[[./toadstool.png]]



*** Reward frequency

The reward frequency can vary:

- fixed rate
- variable rate
- activity rate (the more you do, the more you win)

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Clash of clans has a very addictive (and effective) rewarding system
[[./clashclans.png]]



*** Punishment

Punishment is, along with reinforcement, a very effective way of controlling player behaviour



*** Balance

The "perfect" game design achieves a good balance between reward and punishment

** Learning curve and difficulty

Players (humans) have a limited memory span

Memory is limited in terms of amount of elements to be learnt, and the amount of time the learning perdures



** Teach one mechanic at a time

Focusing on one single thing eases learing

If only one mechanic at a time in taught, the player will have less difficulties



** Let the player practice

One a mechanic is "described", it is important to let the player practice in order to fixate the behavior



** Repetition

Repeating behavior fixates memories

However, repetition needs to be spaced to be effective

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Spaced repetition
[[./spaced_repetition.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

This means that mechanics have to be refreshed, especially at the
beginning of the game

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Shooting gallery in Zelda Ocarina of time
[[./shootinggallery.png]]



** Interface and HUD

The game interface connects the player with the game world

The interface defines the input/output protocol

[[./interface.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

The interface is not only what is displayed on the screen

Every aspect of the communication between the system and the player is
part of the interface

[[./dualshock.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Designing a videogame for computer and for console is challenging
because the players can have very different controllers

- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Touchscreen
- Gamepad
- VR headset

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_quote
  Not every gameplay con be played fully satisfactory with every input
#+end_quote

* Level Design




** Conceptualization

Conceptualizing a level requires answering (among others) these
questions:

- Why does the player need the level?
- Why does the game need the level?



*** How to come up with a level


1. Mental ideation
2. Pen and paper draft
3. Draft in level editor

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_quote
  If the level seems long and boring, then *it is* long and boring
#+end_quote



** Worlds

Game mechanics must be put to action when playing a level (that is why
we have them!)

But, in general, remember that /walking is not a mechanic/, it is just
the way to go from one point to another



** Characters

Levels contain other characters, and these characters also play a role
in a level

[[./guardocarina.png]]



** Interest and anticipation

#+caption: A good camera layout and the appropriate decoration can
provide a good ambience
[[./expectation.png]]



** Design, graphics and sound

The designer, generally, is not directly involved in the creation of
artistic assets for the levels

However, there must be a dialogue between designers and artists for the
assets to make sense inside the level



** Design coherence

Overall, the level must be coherent

#+caption: Lake Hylia in the Zelda series
[[./hylia.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

It does not make sense to have stimpacks in ancient ruins!

* Writing levels




** Level objectives

A level presents, at least, one objective

(Ideally, only one. But this obviously depends)

It must be created as a /unit/

#+REVEAL: split

More elements and complexity does not mean more fun

#+REVEAL: split

Levels should not have too many objetives, because of learning
principles

#+REVEAL: split

Levels should be playable in one single game session (i.e. should not be
too long)

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: It is very useful to organize and structure the progression of game levels
[[./levelorganization.png]]

** Challenging player skills

Levels must challenge player skills in order to be interesting

# #+begin_html
#   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Phs2DhzGie4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>  </iframe>
# #+end_html



** Rhythm and tension

Demanding areas (many enemies, for instance) require energy from the
player

Balancing effort and relax is necessary for the player to keep on at the
appropriate pace

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Towns are a classic resource for implementing a relaxing safe zone
[[./zelda2town.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Tension arc in Mass Effect 3
[[./masseffect.png]]



** Use what the player knows

In order to have the player advance, use previous knowledge (mechanics
and dynamics) along the level

Additionally, is is crucial to design the game so that, at every spot in
a level, all the required mechanics have been taught and *checked*
(i.e. the game "knows" that the player knows the mechanic)



** Avoid repetition

Repeating the same mechanic over and over, once the player has mastered
it, is boring

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: In Final Fantasy VI, many similar combats take place
[[./ff6combat.png]]

* Technology and level design




** Prototyping


#+REVEAL: split

Before building the level, a few questions must be answered:

- Environment type
- Time of day
- Size
- Expected time of gameplay
- Enemies
- Abilities required
- Overall objective in game

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Map conceputalization
[[./concept_mapa.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

#+REVEAL: split

[[./conceptstrikeforce.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

[[./boceto3dstrike.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

[[./model3dstrike.png]]



** Building simple prototypes

Levels with name are easy to remember!

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: Levels can be named
[[./levelname.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Linear levels con provide extra paths with rewards for the players that
spend time on them



** Constructing levels with tools

* Level elements




** Geometry

[[./blockmesh.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

The first version of a level is built with blocks

Designers can do this without the help of artists (fast!)

It is a great technique to test the level

*Final geometry should have the same bounding boxes*



** Objects and items

Level objects can be part of the level, by guiding and rewarding the
player

#+REVEAL: split

[[./coinsgalaxy.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Needed objects must be placed in parts of the level that can be reached,
and inform the user appropriately

[[./objectsnaughty.png]]



** Rooms, spaces and scenes

#+caption: The shape of the level indicates where to go
[[./tube.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

[[./monster.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

#+caption: ...or where not to go yet!
[[./pokemonsnorlax.png]]

** Colors, shapes, information

[[./arrow_planet.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Reusing stereotypes helps!

- Green: go
- Red: don't go



** Affordances

[[./bins.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

#+begin_quote
  If it looks like I can go there, the player should be able to go there  (and vice-versa!)
#+end_quote

#+REVEAL: split

** Affordances direct and help the player

[[./bigaffordances.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

[[./unchartedlevel.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Showing the non-directly achievable solution for the current problem informs the user

[[./ocarinagate.png]]

* Perspective and game types


#+REVEAL: split

Perspective does not only change aesthetics, it also changes gameplay

#+REVEAL: split

It is important not to confuse 3D aesthetics with 3D gameplay

#+CAPTION: 2D gameplay can happen in 3D
[[./raymanlegends.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Even 2D technology can support 3D!

[[./doom2_2d_sprite.png]]



** Top down 2D

[[./zeldasnes.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

- The player sees the surroundings
- Jumping is (sometimes) tricky
- Mastering character movements can be part of the fun
- Although we live in a 3D world, many human tasks actually happen in 2D

#+REVEAL: split

Level layout is like mapping

Accessing parts is based on puzzles, not gamepad mastery



** 2D sidescroller

[[./smbscroller.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

- Very focused, usually, on arcade mechanics
- Low level movement is the core of the gameplay
- Not well suited for labyrinths and puzzles (we have one less
  dimension)

#+REVEAL: split

Linear level layouts

Up and down requires managing gravity

Getting to different parts of the level needs mastering the controls



** 3D FPS

[[./skyrim.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

"Realistic" levels

Player perspective is very limited, so information must be very salient

No information about the exact position of the players body, pixel
perfect manoeuvering is not a good idea



** 3D third person

[[./skyrimthird.png]]

#+REVEAL: split

Similar to 3D FPS

Wider range

If the camera is close to the player, levels have the same requirements
as FPS

#+REVEAL: split

However, some times 3D third person resembles 2D perspective (and thus,
2D levels)

[[./twaliens.png]]

* Playtesting

** Level performance

Some times the level is playable, but it does not have the desired effect

Or, some times, the players do not perform the way the think they should

#+REVEAL: split

It is important to test that the level works according to the designed objective

** Level design bugs

The implementation of a game mechanic can have a bug (programming team), but the level implementation (the /construction/) can have problems too

# #+begin_html
#   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dPWhl2rxGHs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>  </iframe>
# #+end_html

** External testers

The designer's performance when testing a videogame is typically much
better than the average player's

It is *fundamental* to test the game with external players

These players should represent our *target* (i.e. not only friends!)

** Testing the game design and the levels is *fundamental*

Think \(\rightarrow\) Run \(\rightarrow\) Test

* Conclusions




** Game design is an amazing, complex discipline




** The game design document is the most common, useful deliverable




** Player cognition must be taken into account




** Different genres need different mechanics and dynamics




** Game and interface are strongly coupled




** Narratives are fundamental for engagement




** Levels must be prototyped, then tested to check the hypotheses
